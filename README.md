# Chronic Kidney Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning

This repository contains a machine learning model for predicting chronic kidney disease (CKD) based on various medical parameters. The model is developed using Python and popular machine learning libraries such as scikit-learn, pandas, and matplotlib. 🩺📊

## Dataset
The dataset used for training and testing the model is the Chronic Kidney Disease dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It consists of various clinical and laboratory features related to CKD, such as age, blood pressure, specific gravity, albumin, sugar, red blood cells, pus cell, etc. The dataset also includes the target variable indicating the presence or absence of CKD. 📉
